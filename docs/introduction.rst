Introduction
============

This page introduces ensemble methods available in Ensemble-PyTorch in a nutshell.

To begin with, below are some notations that will be used throughout the introduction.

- :math:`\mathcal{B} = \{\mathbf{x}_i, y_i\}_{i=1}^B`: A batch of data with :math:`B` samples;
- :math:`\{h^1, h^2, \cdots, h^m, \cdots, h^M\}`: A set of :math:`M` base estimators;
- :math:`\mathbf{o}_i^m`: The output of the base estimator :math:`h^m` on sample :math:`\mathbf{x}_i`. For regression, it is a scalar or a real-valued vector; For classification, it is a class vector with its size the number of classes;
- :math:`\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{o}_i, y_i)`: Training loss computated upon the output :math:`\mathbf{o}_i` on :math:`\mathbf{x}_i` and the ground-truth :math:`y_i`. For regression, it could be the common mean squared error; For classification, it could be the cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.

Fusion
------

The output of fusion is the averaged output of all base estimators. Formally, given a sample :math:`\mathbf{x}_i`, the output of fusion is :math:`\mathbf{o}_i = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{o}_i^m`.

During the training stage, all base estimators in fusion are jointly trained with mini-batch gradient desecent. Given the output of fusion on a data batch :math:`\mathcal{B}`, the training loss is: :math:`\frac{1}{B} \sum_{i=1}^B \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{o}_i, y_i)`. After then, learnable parameters of all base estimator can be jointly updated with the auto-differentiation system in PyTorch and gradient descent. The figure below presents the data flow of fusion:

Gradient Boosting
-----------------

Gradient boosting trains all base estimators in a sequential fashion, as the learning target of a base estimator :math:`h^m` is associated with the outputs from base estimators fitted before, i.e., :math:`\{h^1, \cdots, h^{m-1}\}`.

Given the :math:`M` base estimators fitted in gradient boosting, the output of the entire ensemble on a sample is :math:`\mathbf{o}_i = \sum_{m=1}^M \epsilon \mathbf{o}_i^m`, where :math:`\epsilon` is a pre-defined scalar in the range :math:`(0, 1]`, and known as the shrinkage rate or learning rate in gradient boosting.

The training routine of the m-th base estimator in gradient boosting can be summarized as follow:

- **Find the learning target on each sample** :math:`\mathbf{r}_i^m`: Given the summation on outputs from base estimators fitted before: :math:`\mathbf{o}_i^{[:m]}=\sum_{p=1}^{m-1} \epsilon \mathbf{o}_i^p` and the ground truth :math:`y_i`, the learning target is defined as :math:`\mathbf{r}_i^m = - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{o}_i^{[:m]},\ y_i)}{\partial \mathbf{o}_i^{[:m]}}`. According to its definition, the learning target is simply the negative gradient of :math:`\mathcal{L}` with respect to the summation on outputs from base estimators fitted before :math:`\mathbf{o}_i^{[:m]}`;
- **Train the m-th base estimator via least square regresison**, that is, the traing loss for the m-th base estimator is :math:`l^m = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{i=1}^B \|\mathbf{r}_i^m - \mathbf{o}_i^m\|_2^2`. Given :math:`l^m`, the learnable parameters of :math:`h^m` then can be fitted using gradient descent;
- **Update the fitted output**: :math:`\mathbf{o}_i^{[:m+1]} = \mathbf{o}_i^{[:m]} + \epsilon \mathbf{o}_i^m`, and then move to the training routine of the (m+1)-th base estimator.

For regression with the mean squared error, :math:`\mathbf{r}_i^m = \mathbf{y}_i - \mathbf{o}_i^{[:m]}`. For classification with the cross-entropy loss, :math:`\mathbf{r}_i^m = \mathbf{y}_i - \text{Softmax}(\mathbf{o}_i^{[:m]})`, where :math:`\mathbf{y}_i` is the one-hot encoded vector of the class label :math:`y_i`.

The figure below presents the data flow of gradient boosting during the training and evaluating stage, respectively. Notice that the training stage runs sequentially from the left to right.
